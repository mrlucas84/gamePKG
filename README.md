----------------------------------------------

Information:
----------------------------------------------

gamePKG is an application for the PS3 that allows
the user to queue PKG files for later installation
from the XMB "without restarting the PS3 at all".

Main objective of this application is to help
users on Rogero CFW 4.30 (v2.03) to install
PKGs without wasting much time.

Technical Info:
----------------------------------------------

Tested on Rogero CFW 4.30 (v2.03)

Should work on 3.40+ CFW

The application will scan the following directories
for PKG files:

- /dev_hdd0/pkg/
- /dev_hdd0/package/
- /dev_usb000/
- /dev_usb000/pkg/
- /dev_usb000/package/
- /dev_usb001/
- /dev_usb001/pkg/
- /dev_usb001/package/
- /dev_usb002/
- /dev_usb002/pkg/
- /dev_usb002/package/
- /dev_usb003/
- /dev_usb003/pkg/
- /dev_usb003/package/

NOTES: 
-----------------------------------------------
The application handles big PKG files without problem, 
remember that these take some time to copy, make sure to 
have at least double the space on the HDD.

- The application doesn't support re-scaning devices for new PKG files (for now)
- The application doesn't verify HDD for previously queued files (for now)
- The application doesn't display a Progress bar (for now)
- The application doesn't support split PKG files (for now)
- The application doesn't support removing Queued PKG (for now) 
- The application doesn't have any special GUI (don't know how to, sorry lol) 

Usage:
----------------------------------------------

- Use UP and DOWN to select PKGs
- Press (X) to Queue the selected PKG
- Press (O) to Quit and return to XMB
